# Changelog

All notable changes to **KCNA Prep** are documented here.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-06-18

### Changed
- **Contributors page** now uses LinkedIn-style cards — avatar, name, role, a
  link to each person's LinkedIn, and a short bio — with refreshed entries for
  Sean Keenan, Michael Gaspard, and Ross Davies.

> 🙏 *Why: the people behind the app deserve more than a one-line credit.*

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Multi-language interface** — a new 🌐 language menu in the top bar (and a
  matching picker in **Settings**) translates the whole app UI into **10
  languages**: English, Español, Português, Français, Deutsch, Italiano,
  简体中文, 日本語, हिन्दी, and العربية. Your choice is saved per device, and the
  app auto-detects your browser's language on first visit.
- **Right-to-left layout** for Arabic — the interface mirrors correctly (menus,
  nav, lists, and panels).

### Notes
- Study **content stays in English** — notes, flashcards, and exam questions —
  because the KCNA exam is administered in English. Localizing the interface
  keeps the app approachable while you still practice the real exam terminology
  (Pod, Deployment, Ingress…), which is intentionally kept in English everywhere.

> 🌍 *Why: a study tool shouldn't gatekeep on language. Now teammates across the
> Americas can navigate in their own — and still meet the exam on its terms.*

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-18

### Added
- **Your difficulty level is now shown in the top bar** — where the old "Offline"
  chip used to be. New / Some / Experienced is always visible, so you know exactly
  which difficulty you're practising at, and clicking it still opens the picker.
- **About, README, Contributors, and Changelog now open inside the app** instead of
  bouncing out to GitHub. README and Changelog render the project's own Markdown,
  and a new **Contributors** page credits the people who've helped.

### Changed
- **Removed the top-bar "Offline" indicator** — it told you little you didn't
  already know, and the spot is better used for your difficulty level.

> 🧭 *Why: thanks to **Ross Davies** for both nudges — he breezed through a session
> and said it was too easy (fair, but he couldn't tell which level he was on, so the
> difficulty now lives in the chrome), and he called out the "Offline" pill as wasted
> space. "About" quietly leaving the app for GitHub always felt like being shown the
> door, too.*

## [1.6.2] - 2026-06-18

### Security
- **Hardened session import.** Imported `.seanyprep` files are now checked against
  a per-key allowlist and expected shape before anything is written to storage, and
  `Progress.stats()` normalizes every entry on read — so a corrupt or hostile file
  can no longer crash the Readiness, Report, or Dashboard views.
- **Locked down link and report rendering.** All `href` links are escaped and
  scheme-checked (`safeUrl()` permits only in-app routes and `http(s)`/`mailto`),
  `esc()` now escapes single quotes too, mock-score values are coerced to numbers,
  and the downloadable `.html` report ships with its own strict Content-Security-
  Policy. `upgrade-insecure-requests` was added everywhere it was missing (local
  dev server and the page `<meta>`).

### Fixed
- Removed dead code, debounced the report's "Prepared by" field so it no longer
  rebuilds the whole document on every keystroke, and unified the two toast
  notifications so an app toast and a PWA-update toast can't stack on top of
  each other.

> 🛡️ *Why: thanks to **Michael Gaspard** for the nudge to run a proper
> CSRF / SSRF / XSS review. The verdict was reassuring — nothing exploitable on a
> static, no-auth, local app — but a few latent sharp edges got sanded down anyway.
> Belt, suspenders, and one more belt for luck.*

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Mock-score trend chart** in the progress report — a clean SVG line of your
  mock-exam scores over time with the 75% pass mark drawn in, so a manager sees
  the trajectory at a glance (renders in print and the downloaded file too).
- **Footer links** across the app: **About**, **README**, **Contributors**, and
  **Changelog**.

> 📈 *Why: a line going up and to the right says more in one glance than a table
> ever will — and now the footer admits where this thing actually lives.*

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Progress report for your manager** — a new **Progress report** page (linked
  from the dashboard and Readiness) generates a clean, professional one-pager:
  a plain-language readiness verdict, predicted score vs. the pass mark, domain
  mastery by exam weight, study activity, and mock-exam history. Add your name and
  (optionally) your scheduled exam date, then **Print / Save as PDF**, **download a
  standalone `.html` file** to email, or **copy a text summary** to paste into chat.

> 🧑‍💼 *Why: "are you actually studying?" deserves a one-click answer. Hand the boss
> a tidy PDF and reclaim your afternoons.*

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- **No more first-run onboarding modal.** Returning users (who load a session
  file) are no longer interrupted. Pick your difficulty from a new **difficulty
  button in the top bar** instead — it opens New / Some / Experienced and marks
  the current choice.
- **Study plans no longer display a total-week count.** Plans are still designed
  to different depths internally, but the headline "N-week plan" is hidden so it
  doesn't conflict with the hard Oct 1 deadline.

### Added
- **Adaptive difficulty** — when you're scoring well on both practice questions
  (≥85%) and flashcards (≥80%), the app offers to bump you up a level. Asked at
  most once per level; flashcard accuracy is now tracked to power this.

> 🥋 *Why: nobody wants a "choose your fighter" screen on every launch, telling a
> seasoned engineer they have "7 weeks" when the boss said "October" helps no one,
> and if you're clearly smurfing the easy questions the app should have the decency
> to notice and put you in the deep end.*

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Experience-level personalization** — a first-run prompt (and a Settings
  control) asks how familiar you are with Kubernetes, then tailors the app to
  **New / Some / Experienced**. Because sessions are per-person, each user gets
  their own fit. It drives:
  - **Study plan** — three distinct plans: a gentle ~12-week foundational plan
    (New), the ~11-week balanced plan (Some), and an accelerated diagnose-first
    ~7-week plan (Experienced). Each shows a "tailored for…" strategy card.
  - **Practice difficulty** — free practice quizzes lean easier for New and
    harder for Experienced (the diagnostic and mock stay representative so
    readiness and scores remain honest).
  - **Flashcard default** — Experienced starts in type-the-answer mode; others
    in multiple-choice (your explicit choice always wins).
  - **Guidance & tone** — the Plan and Readiness pages show level-specific advice.

> 🎚️ *Why: one-size-fits-all fits no one. The person on day one and the person who
> babysits prod clusters for a living should not get the same homework.*

## [1.3.1] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- Deadline warning is now simply dismissible: removed the "Book exam" and
  "I've scheduled it" buttons in favor of a **✕ close** control in the top-right.
  Dismissal persists; re-show it via **Settings → Deadline & plan → Deadline warning**.

> 🚪 *Why: two buttons walked into a banner. We showed them the ✕. The banner is
> roomier and much calmer now.*

## [1.3.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- **Countdown now targets the company deadline to pass the KCNA by Oct 1, 2026**
  (was the Sept 1 exam date). The top-bar and dashboard countdowns, study plan,
  and readiness all reflect the new date.

### Added
- A persistent **"book your exam" warning** on the dashboard (the app can't
  schedule the exam for you), with a one-click link to the official registration
  page and an **"I've scheduled it"** action. The reminder escalates within 30
  days of the deadline and can be toggled in **Settings → Deadline & plan**.
- A study-plan task to book the exam seat during mock-exam week.

> ⏰ *Why: a company-wide deadline materialized, as they do. The app double-checked
> and, no, it still cannot sit the exam on your behalf — so it will keep poking you
> to book it yourself.*

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Save / Load session** menu in the top bar (save icon → "Save session…" /
  "Load session…"), so several people can share one device without accounts —
  each keeps their own session file and loads it when they sit down.
  - Sessions save as **`KCNA Exam Prep - YYYY-MM-DD HHMM.seanyprep`**.
  - Uses the **File System Access API** to open a native dialog that **defaults to
    the Documents folder** (Chrome/Edge); falls back to a normal download +
    file-picker on Safari/Firefox.
  - Loading a session cleanly **replaces** the current progress (a true switch
    between users), after validating the file.

### Removed
- The separate **Export / Import progress** buttons in Settings — superseded by
  the top-bar Save / Load session menu (one consistent file flow).

> 💾 *Why: "just use the same browser tab, everyone" is not multi-user support —
> it's a group trust fall. Now each person clutches their own `.seanyprep` file.*

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-17

### Changed
- **Visual redesign styled after the Nutanix brand guidelines** so the app feels
  familiar to Nutanix colleagues (this is an independent study app, not a Nutanix
  product, and it does not use the Nutanix logo or wordmark):
  - **Color system** — Iris Purple (`#7855FA`) primary on Charcoal Gray
    (`#131313`), with Aqua Blue, Mantis Green, and Peach Pink accents. Both the
    dark and light themes were re-derived from the official palette.
  - **Typography** — switched to **Montserrat** (the Nutanix brand typeface) with
    Arial as the system fallback.
  - Recolored the app icon, favicon, PWA/maskable icons, and `theme-color`.
- Bumped the service-worker cache to `v1.1.0` so returning users get the refresh.

> 🎨 *Why: so it feels like home for Nutanix colleagues — purple and all — minus
> the actual logo, because trademark law is not whimsical.*

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-17

The first packaged, enterprise-grade release. Everything below ships in one go:
the original study app plus the tooling, deployment, and knowledge features that

- **Flashcards** — 139 spaced-repetition cards (SM-2 lite) with Easy (multiple
  choice), Hard (type-the-answer with fuzzy grading), and Flip review modes.
- **Practice** — 253 fact-checked questions: per-domain quizzes, a 25-question
  diagnostic, and a full 60-question / 90-minute mock weighted to the real exam.
- **Readiness** — honest readiness score, predicted exam score, pass likelihood,
  per-domain mastery, and recommended next actions.
- **Plan** — an 11-week study plan with a live countdown and check-off tasks.

#### Knowledge base & references
- **Reference** section: a searchable **Glossary** of essential KCNA terms, a
  curated set of **authoritative documentation links** per domain (kubernetes.io,
  CNCF, Prometheus, Helm, Argo CD, and more), verified **exam facts**, and an
  official-resources list.
- **Further reading / Sources** on each domain's Learn page.

#### New features
- **Settings** page: configurable exam date and plan start, light/dark/auto theme,
  reduced-motion preference, and one-click **export / import / reset** of progress.
- **Light theme** plus automatic OS theme matching.
- **Global search** (`⌘/Ctrl + K`) across notes, glossary, and topics.
- **Progress export / import** as a JSON file so you can move between devices.
- **Study streak** tracking surfaced on the dashboard.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for quizzes and flashcards, with a `?` help overlay.

- **Accessibility**: skip link, ARIA live route announcements, focus management,
  reduced-motion support, and labelled controls.

#### Engineering, security & deployment
- MIT `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CITATION.cff`.
- **Security**: `SECURITY.md` policy, a full `docs/SECURITY-AUDIT.md` threat model,
  a Content-Security-Policy, and hardened response headers for every deploy target.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for linting/validation/link-checking, CodeQL scanning,
  and automatic GitHub Pages deployment; Dependabot for action updates.
- **One-command deploy**: Docker (`Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` + hardened
  `nginx.conf`), Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, and cross-platform local launchers.
- Issue/PR templates, `CODEOWNERS`, `Makefile`, and `docs/` (deployment, content
  authoring, architecture, and security).

> 🌱 *Why: it set out to be a humble study app and woke up with CI, a threat model,
> and a Dockerfile. They grow up so fast.*
