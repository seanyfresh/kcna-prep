## Exam blueprint (current, 2026)

> ⚠️ **The KCNA exam was updated (effective ~Nov 24, 2025).** It now has **four**
> domains, not five — **Observability is examined within Cloud Native Architecture**.
> This app uses the current weights, so your mock exams match the real test. Verified
> against [training.linuxfoundation.org](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/kubernetes-cloud-native-associate/)
> and [cncf.io](https://www.cncf.io/training/certification/kcna/).

| Domain | Weight |
|---|---|
| Kubernetes Fundamentals | 44% |
| Container Orchestration | 28% |
| Cloud Native Application Delivery | 16% |
| Cloud Native Architecture *(includes Observability)* | 12% |

**Exam facts:** 60 multiple-choice questions · 90 minutes · pass mark **75%** ·
online/remotely proctored · **$250** USD (one free retake) · certification valid **2 years**.
*(Always confirm the latest details on the official exam page before booking.)*

## Security

A fully client-side app with a small, well-defended attack surface: strict
Content-Security-Policy, escaped rendering, validated imports, hardened response
headers on every deploy target, and automated CodeQL scanning. Full write-up:

**[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)**.
